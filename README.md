# Spring Boot Calculator Application

A simple calculator application built using Spring Boot. This application provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) through a REST API and a simple web interface.

## Features

- Perform basic calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- RESTful API for each operation.
- Front-end interface with HTML and JavaScript for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The main programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for creating the REST API and managing the application.
- **Thymeleaf** (optional): Template engine for rendering HTML pages.
- **HTML & JavaScript**: For the simple front-end interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spring-boot-calculator
   ```
3. Build the project with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   Or, if using Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   Or, if using Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle bootRun
   ```
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the calculator interface.

## Usage

### REST API Endpoints

The application exposes the following endpoints for basic arithmetic operations:

- **Addition**: `GET /calculator/add?a={value1}&b={value2}`
- **Subtraction**: `GET /calculator/subtract?a={value1}&b={value2}`
- **Multiplication**: `GET /calculator/multiply?a={value1}&b={value2}`
- **Division**: `GET /calculator/divide?a={value1}&b={value2}`

For example, to add 10 and 5, you can call:
```
http://localhost:8080/calculator/add?a=10&b=5
```

### Front-End Interface

A simple HTML page is provided at the root URL (`http://localhost:8080`) with input fields and buttons for each operation. Enter two numbers, select an operation, and see the result displayed on the page.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main application and the `CalculatorController` for handling requests.
- `src/main/resources/templates`: Contains `index.html`, which provides a simple UI for user interaction.
- `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Configuration file for the application.

## Error Handling

- Division by zero will throw an error message indicating that the operation is not allowed.
